It involves analyzing the words and phrases  used in the text to underlying sentiment, whether it is a positive, negative or neutral.\n","\n","***Lexicon-based analysis***\n","\n","This type of analysis, such as the NLTK Vader sentiment analyzer, involves using a set of predefined rules and heuristics to determine the sentiment of a piece of text. These rules are typically based on lexical and syntactic features of the text, such as the presence of positive or negative words and phrases.\n","\n","While **lexicon-based analysis** can be relatively simple to implement and interpret, it may not be as accurate as ML-based or transformed-based approaches, especially when dealing with complex or ambiguous text data.\n","\n","***Machine learning (ML)***\n","\n","This approach involves training a model to identify the sentiment of a piece of text based on a set of labeled training data. These models can be trained using a wide range of ML algorithms, including decision trees, support vector machines (SVMs), and neural networks.\n","\n","ML-based approaches can be more accurate than rule-based analysis, especially when dealing with complex text data, but they require a larger amount of labeled training data and may be more computationally expensive.\n","\n","***Pre-trained transformer-based deep learning***\n","\n","A deep learning-based approach, as seen with BERT and GPT-4, involve using pre-trained models trained on massive amounts of text data. These models use complex neural networks to encode the context and meaning of the text, allowing them to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on a wide range of NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis. However, these models require significant computational resources and may not be practical for all use cases.\n","\n","\n","\n","*   Lexicon-based analysis is a straightforward approach to sentiment analysis, but it may not be as accurate as more complex methods.\n","*   Machine learning-based approaches can be more accurate, but they require labeled training data and may be more computationally expensive.\n","*  Pre-trained transformer-based deep learning approaches can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy but require significant computational resources and may not be practical for all use cases.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"17VyvN-nIhNT"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{"id":"CYVJGfuZABED","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1726597130917,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":458,"user":{"displayName":"Girish Sawant","userId":"12640254904140780260"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["#Importing required libraries\n","\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n","import nltk\n","#nltk.download('all')\n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n","from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\n","from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n","import re\n","from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Reading the dataset\n","\n","df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pycaret/pycaret/master/datasets/amazon.csv')\n","df.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"IbQTJd_UA_R3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1726595733744,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1721,"user":{"displayName":"Girish Sawant","userId":"12640254904140780260"}},"outputId":"2a568a2b-8770-4609-fb87-65968eea5da6"},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                          reviewText  Positive\n","0  This is a one of the best apps acording to a b...         1\n","1  This is a pretty good version of the game for ...         1\n","2  this is a really cool game. there are a bunch ...         1\n","3  This is a silly game and can be frustrating, b...         1\n","4  This is a terrific game on any pad.
